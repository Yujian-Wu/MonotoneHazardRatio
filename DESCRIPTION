Title: Nonparametric Estimation and Inference of a Monotone Hazard Ratio Function
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yujian Wu
Maintainer: Yujian Wu <yujianwu@umass.edu>
Description: This package provides nonparametrical estimation and inference for a non- decreasing monotone hazard
    ratio from a right censored survival dataset.  The
    estimator is based on a generalized Grenander typed estimator, and the
    inference procedure is based on direct plugin estimation.  More
    details please refer to:"Nonparametric inference under a monotone
    hazard ratio order" <arxiv:2205.01745>.
